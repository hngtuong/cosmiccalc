# `cosmiccalc` (originally stylized as CosmiCalc)

A web-based build simulator for a (now out-of-service) 3D MMOTPS [CosmicBreak](http://cosmicbreak.cyberstep.com).  
CyberStep has revealed the new version of the game called [Cosmic Break Universal](https://cosmicbreak-universal.com/).

**Thanks to the massive contribution from [hngtuong](https://github.com/hngtuong), seems like we have updated data for CBUNI again (as of 2021-05-13).**  
The update broke most if not all existing builds though unfortunately.
